    question: "What is a digital nomad visa and who is it for?",
    answer:
      "A digital nomad visa is a special residence permit that allows remote workers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs to legally live and work in a foreign country while working for clients or employers outside that country. It's perfect for anyone with location-independent income who wants to experience life abroad legally.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the visa application process typically take?",
    answer:
      "Processing times vary by country, ranging from 2 weeks to 4 months. Portugal's D7 visa typically takes 2-3 months, Spain's digital nomad visa around 20 business days, and Thailand's LTR visa approximately 30 days. I'll provide accurate timelines based on your chosen destination and current processing speeds.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the typical income requirements for digital nomad visas?",
    answer:
      "Income requirements vary significantly by country. Portugal requires approximately €3,040/month, Spain around €2,646/month, while Thailand's LTR visa requires $80,000/year. Some countries also accept proof of savings instead of regular income. I'll help you find destinations that match your financial situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring my family on a digital nomad visa?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Most digital nomad visa programs allow you to include dependents such as spouses, partners, and children. Requirements vary by country, and additional income proof may be needed for each family member. My Voyager and Elite plans include full support for family applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my visa application is rejected?",
    answer:
      "While my 95% success rate speaks for itself, if your application is rejected, I'll analyze the reasons, help you address any issues, and guide you through the appeal process at no additional cost. My Elite plan includes a full money-back guarantee if I can't secure your visa.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay taxes in my destination country?",
    answer:
      "Tax obligations vary by country and your specific situation. Some countries like Portugal offer favorable tax regimes for new residents (NHR program), while others like Croatia exempt digital nomad visa holders from local income tax. I include tax advisory in my Voyager and Elite plans to help you stay compliant.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maintain my visa status once approved?",
    answer:
      "Requirements vary by visa type but typically include minimum stay requirements, maintaining income levels, and renewing before expiration. My ongoing support ensures you never miss a deadline, and I handle all renewal paperwork. Elite members get proactive compliance monitoring.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work for local clients or start a local business?",
    answer:
      "Most digital nomad visas restrict you to working for foreign clients/employers only. However, some countries offer pathways to business registration and local work permits. My Business Registration service helps you set up compliant structures if you want to expand locally.",
